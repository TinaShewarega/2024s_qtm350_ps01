War predictions 

## Project Description
In the War Prediction title, we seek to predict the probability of war by collecting, analyzing, and constructing models on the data revolving around wars. The data may include the parameters of conditions pre-war and post-war to train the model such as political adversity level and economic dependency indicators. Group members are El, Gina, Tina. 

## Contribution by each Member
El is responsible for data collection and preprocessing.
Gina is responsible for extracting important features from the data. 
Tina is responsible for model training and evaluation. 
As a group, we all contributed to the model selection. 

## Challenges faced and how they were overcome
Challenges faced during our analysis is figuring out factors to look into when we predict the probability of a war happening. Among these factors are political, economic, social, and cultural dimensions. The complexity of these interactions makes analysing the data and making predictions inherently difficult, demanding a careful selection and weighting of factors to construct a robust predictive model. Moreover, the presence of bias, whether in historical data or analytical frameworks, further complicates the endeavor. We overcame this challenge by carefully selecting the data we use, employing multidisciplinary collaboration, and conducting a ridge regression analysis.
