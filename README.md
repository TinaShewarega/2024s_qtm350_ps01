War predictions 
<<<<<<< HEAD
## Project Description
In the War Prediction title, we seek to predict the probability of war by collecting, analyzing, and constructing models on the data revolving around wars. The data may include the parameters of conditions pre-war and post-war to train the model such as political adversity level and economic dependency indicators. Group members are El, Gina, Tina. 
## Contribution by each Member
El is responsible for data collection and preprocessing.
Gina is responsible for extracting important features from the data. 
Tina is responsible for model training and evaluation. 
As a group, we all contributed to the model selection.

"War predictability" refers to the ability or attempt to forecast or anticipate the occurrence, duration, intensity, or outcomes of armed conflicts between nations, states, or other organized groups. This is a complex and challenging task due to the multitude of factors involved in conflicts, including political, economic, social, and cultural dynamics. Historically, various methods and theories have been proposed to predict or understand the likelihood of war, but achieving accurate predictions remains elusive.
