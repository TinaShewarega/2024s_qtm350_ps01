War predictions 


## Challenges faced and how they were overcome
Challenges faced during our analysis is figuring out factors to look into when we predict the probability of a war happening. Among these factors are political, economic, social, and cultural dimensions. The complexity of these interactions makes analysing the data and making predictions inherently difficult, demanding a careful selection and weighting of factors to construct a robust predictive model. Moreover, the presence of bias, whether in historical data or analytical frameworks, further complicates the endeavor. We overcame this challenge by carefully selecting the data we use, employing multidisciplinary collaboration, and conducting a ridge regression analysis.
