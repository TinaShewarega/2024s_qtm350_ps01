War predictions 

"War predictability" refers to the ability or attempt to forecast or anticipate the occurrence, duration, intensity, or outcomes of armed conflicts between nations, states, or other organized groups. This is a complex and challenging task due to the multitude of factors involved in conflicts, including political, economic, social, and cultural dynamics. Historically, various methods and theories have been proposed to predict or understand the likelihood of war, but achieving accurate predictions remains elusive.
